message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it \r\nto my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to \r\nher ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it \r\npinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\n\r\nLoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell \r\nsomeone!"
