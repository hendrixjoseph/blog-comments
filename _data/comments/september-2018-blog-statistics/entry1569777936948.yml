message: "At the day's end I put it and leave them.  The telephones have to be put in the case in a method \r\nthat is specific to fit.  I can see your point that appropriate measurement equipment is pricey, however I \r\nfeel as if there might have been one essential question here which has not been answered yet.\r\nThe single complaint might be that the Momentum bass is not as \r\npowerful as some might like.  The bass sounds deep and \r\nhas a purr, not a spin.  A bass is advertised by \r\nthe VMODA Crossfade M-100.  With an remarkable sound quality and a bass,\r\nthe more VMODA Crossfade M-100 is worth your money!\r\nThe addition of the VMODA Crossfade M-100 in top five bass headphones is well deserved.\r\nIf you're a fan of music like scores or jazz and despise that you can not hear it in people, that mode assists with it."
