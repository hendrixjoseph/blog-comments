I mean blog \r\ntopic is a little vanilla. You might glance at Yahoo's front page and see \r\nhow they create news headlines to grab people to open the links.\r\nYou might add a video or a related pic or two to grab people interested \r\nabout everything've written. Just my opinion, it could bring your posts a \r\nlittle bit more interesting."
