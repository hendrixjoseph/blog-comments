message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea \r\nshell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter \r\nand said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She \r\nplaced the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched \r\nher ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
