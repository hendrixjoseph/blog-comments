message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found \r\na sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She \r\nput the shell to her ear and screamed. There was \r\na hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!"
