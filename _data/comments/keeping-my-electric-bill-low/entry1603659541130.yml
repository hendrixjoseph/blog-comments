On the western bank is the Gandhi Ashram at Sabarmati, which displays the spiritual leaderвЂ™s living quarters and artifacts. Across the river, the Calico Museum of Textiles, once a cloth merchant's mansion, has a significant collection of antique and modern fabrics. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://forums.emc.com/blogs/EmailTips/2018/05/29/how-to-restore-emails-from-ost-file-outlook-2013> Ahmedabad </a>"
