message: "Missing angler search scaled back in light of fatal shooting of 18-year-old\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael O'Brien said the officers had \"only\" shot the 18-year-old. But witnesses described the teen as unarmed.\n\nThe teen's mother told investigators she heard at least two gunshots and that she told her son to put his hands up, O'Brien said.\n\nO'Brien said he would not disclose whether the teen also had a gun, because officers were still at the scene Tuesday.\n\n\"If there is a gun, we will be transparent,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the teens were arguing before the incident.\n\n\"I heard about seven to eight shots and then he died on the ground,\" said Richard Womack, a 17-year-old high school football star who lives nearby.\n\nA neighbor of the teen said the teen had been arguing with the other teen as they got into the home next door.\n\n\"They were arguing over him,\" neighbor Don Cote said. \"They weren't getting along.\"\n\nThe teen died around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, a police source said. A coroner's office said he died Monday night and was identified Tuesday night as Michael Lavergne.\n\nTravis McCloud, the head football coach at St. Francis College, said, \"They're not going to get any praise for their work on Wednesday morning.\"\n\nHe said school will continue on Tuesday, with two practices scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and close Sunday afternoon at 7:30 p.m. \r\n<a href=https://www.forexlingo.com/>우리카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.webix3.com/>우리카지노</a>\r\nï»¿<a href=https://www.prakritikolkata.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.onikssport.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n \r\nUnion protests over lost port kembla work.\n\nThe protests have spread to some of the city's most upscale districts, including the Taj Mahal and the Mahila area, where workers have blocked traffic.\n\nOn Saturday, police fired tear gas and water cannon to try and disperse the crowd.\n\nCabinet member Nitin Gadkari (Left), Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar (Right), MHA chief, and Congress president Sonia Gandhi (L) sit inside a vehicle.
