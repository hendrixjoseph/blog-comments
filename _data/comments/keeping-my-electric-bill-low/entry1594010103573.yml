message: "Peace be unto you. What think ye of Christ? whose Son is He? \r\n \r\nanswer from the Bible: \r\nGod was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. (1 Timothy 3:16). \r\nThis is the true God, and eternal life. (1 John 5:20) \r\nBehold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. (Matthew 1:23) \r\nFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6) \r\nAnd there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. \r\nAnd this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.(Luke 7:16,17) \r\nAnd he that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me.  (John 12:45) \r\nhe that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me. (John 13:20) \r\nthe word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me. (John 14:24) \r\n \r\nWhat to do? \r\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. (John 5:24) \r\nThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? \r\nJesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. (John 6:28,29) \r\nAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? \r\nAnd they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. (Acts of the Apostles 16:30,31) \r\nBut he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? \r\nAnd he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! \r\nFor whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. (Matthew 12:48-50) \r\nAnd this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. \r\nAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:39,40) \r\nAnd this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. \r\nAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:39,40) \r\nThose things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. (Philippians 4:9) \r\n \r\nPeter's sermon: \r\nThen Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: \r\nBut in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. \r\nThe word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all) \r\nThat word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; \r\nHow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. \r\nAnd we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: \r\nHim God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; \r\nNot to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. \r\nAnd he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. \r\nTo him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.(Acts of the Apostles 10:34-43) \r\nRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; \r\nAnd he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you… (Acts of the Apostles 3:19,20) \r\n \r\n \r\nWhat's next? \r\nAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. (Matthew 24:14) \r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. (Mark 16:16) \r\n \r\nThe Second Coming of Jesus Christ: \r\nWhich also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. (Acts of the Apostles 1:11) \r\nThe sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come… (Acts of the Apostles 2:20) \r\nAnd then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. \r\nAnd he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. (Matthew 24:30,31) \r\nFor the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first… (1 Thessalonians 4:16) \r\nAnd have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. (Acts of the Apostles 24:15) \r\nAnd many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. \r\nAnd they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. (Daniel 12:2,3) \r\nBut go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.(Daniel 12:13) \r\n \r\nWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: \r\nAnd before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: \r\nAnd he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. \r\nThen shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: \r\nFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: \r\nNaked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. \r\nThen shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? \r\nWhen saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? \r\nOr when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? \r\nAnd the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. \r\nThen shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: \r\nFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: \r\nI was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. \r\nThen shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? \r\nThen shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. \r\nAnd these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. (Matthew 25:31-46) \r\nAnd if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. \r\nHe that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. (John 12:47,48) \r\n \r\nFor whom it is written: \r\nThen Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all? \r\nAnd the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? \r\nBlessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. \r\nOf a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. \r\nBut and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; \r\nThe lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.(Luke 12:41-46) \r\n \r\nEyewitness accounts: \r\nFor we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. (2 Peter 1:16) \r\nFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; \r\nAnd that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: \r\nAnd that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: \r\nAfter that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. \r\nAfter that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. (1 Corinthians 15:3-7) \r\nEven as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word… (Luke 1:2) \r\n \r\nThe prayer of Jesus Christ: \r\nI pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. (John 17:9) \r\nI pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. (John 17:15) \r\nNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word… (John 17:20) \r\n \r\nWhy is important? \r\nFor the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. (1 Peter 3:12) \r\n \r\nBehold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. (Revelation 3:11) \r\n \r\nJesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. \r\nAnd many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: \r\nBut these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
