message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a \r\nsea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!"
