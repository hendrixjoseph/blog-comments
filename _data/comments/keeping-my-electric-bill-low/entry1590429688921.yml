message: "Federal budget predictions look optimistic barnettering in favor of budget restraint in fiscal 2013, and in the current financial year, Obama will be able to deliver $1 trillion in additional revenue without raising taxes. This won't raise any more revenue than is expected, but instead it will make the deficit significantly smaller, creating the illusion of balance without adding to the deficit. The real effect will be to allow the Administration to increase spending while decreasing revenues.\n\nAs long as the deficit stays under $500 billion, no significant reduction in the budget of the government can occur. We have already seen in recent years a significant decline in spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps and Pell grants in recent years. The economy, the middle class, and the small business sector are suffering as a result of falling prices for imports and declining wages for the working class.\n\nSince the deficit has been above $500 billion in each of the last three fiscal years, the economic contraction created by this President's economic policies should continue over the next couple of years in order to maintain the illusion of balance. \r\n<a href=https://www.khangheshlaghi.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.uzgitwebtasarim.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n \r\nShare market closes down after news on the US election broke\n\n\"We do not need another one of these\"\n\nI know I have, because these days I'm a bit of a stickler for details. So I'll simply say: we do not need another one of these. That's because there aren't any. The Fed has already been taking extraordinary action â€” starting with what could be termed one of the biggest rate cuts of any time in decades. In particular, it slashed rates by 18.5 percentage points in a move that started with a 5.75 percent reduction last December and will extend through the first quarter of this year. And that's not all.\n\nBut for all of those actions, they are still \"too low,\" that is, they are not at all as supportive of a near-term increase in the Fed's \"target rate.\" Those are still pretty modest, as we pointed out. To put those in perspective, the Fed has kept interest rates lower for more than six years. And, yes, even in this recession, when the unemployment rate has dropped from 9.3 percent to 6.1 percent.\n\nSo why do people continue to argue that something is wrong? I have two possible answers. First, they have been in this industry long enough and know enough that there's some sort of crisis brewing on their doorstep. But the other one is that they think the market has gone too far and is about to hit a wall.\n\nWhat's the Fed doing?\n\nIf anyone needs to explain the Fed, here it is.\n\nIt's been saying very clearly that it does not want to \"hurt\" the economy, that it wants to stay \"neutral.\" That means not to pick sides: the Fed has said for the last several months that we're facing a time of \"broad financial accommodation.\" To some, the language is an ominous reminder of what this might look like (see last week's story on the impact of Federal Reserve Policy, below).\n\nBut one of my favorite ways to approach things is simply to understand that there are real differences among all participants on how to manage a crisis. They are not ideological differences, or political differences; they are about how you make sure you do the right things â€” because there is no one right way. But the Fed is doing a good job of making the case that it's all right because it's acting in a way that has all the hallmarks of \"normal\" market behavior â€” a bit of stimulus, an easing of monetary policy, some easing of the debt markets, etc. It should be applauded.\n\nWhat about the market? Why is it acting like this?\n\nThat's a big question. For some it may simply be a matter of bad fait"
