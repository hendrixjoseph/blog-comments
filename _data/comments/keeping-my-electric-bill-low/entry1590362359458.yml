message: "Bieber seeks jackson like fame, and then he has to face the truth: he is as much a \"fan\" as he is a musician. (It doesn't help that he wears fake, fake earpieces.)\n\nThe only thing that might explain the disconnect â€” even if it will require an entire chapter in his first major memoir â€” is that if a writer with a long history of music can't get his work off the ground, where can he look to to build it? If someone is going to create a new music genre or style without any input from outside, then, surely, some of us would ask \"where is the audience\"? Is there a large and dedicated fan base? A place where anyone could join and pay dues? Where will the fans, as an audience, begin and continue to discover something? \r\n<a href=https://www.gohappyclub.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.onikssport.com/>더킹카지노</a>\r\n \r\nPolice investigate mans death on remote station road\n\nEmergency services were called to the station in St Albans at 7.45am and police said a man had been pulled from the water in a submerged vehicle.\n\nA source said: \"Police can confirm that a man was pulled from the River Thames near the station at around 7.25am.\n\n\"Paramedics arrived but at no time was he resuscitated.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with his family and friends.\"\n\nOne witness in the station area told BBC London 4 he saw a man being pulled out of the water in the river after spotting a yellow van and saw him being brought onto the pavement of a nearby car park.\n\nIt is understood the driver, aged 30, a man from West Berkshire, had his face covered, the source said."
