The high court ruled the state can enforce the ban against same-sex marriages but must do so in compliance with the federal constitution's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe ruling followed a federal case in late February that found the state has an unconstitutional ban against same-sex marriage.\n\nThe state had argued a decision that same-sex couples can marry violates the state constitution's ban on marriage. The lawsuit, filed by Virginia and 13 other states, was challenged in federal court in Richmond.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed. In a five-to-four decision, the court decided that the Virginia state Constitution had a reasonable time for considering same-sex marriage, even if the majority ruling struck down it.\n\nSame-sex couples can get married anywhere in Virginia.\n\nThe court also overturned the state's ban on equal pay for women by a 6-to-1 majority.\n\nThe ruling, with four Democrats on the court and two Republicans, was a dramatic departure from a unanimous five-to-four decision by a panel in April 2014.\n\nIn that ruling, the justices gave states six months from the ruling's June 2014 oral arguments before ruling on same-sex marriage issues. \r\n<a href=https://www.gohappyclub.com/>온라인카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\nGold coast woman to head qld youth forum\n\nUpdated\n\nThe Federal Government is calling for Queensland's education minister to take over the Queensland Youth Forum.\n\nKey points The Federal Government wants Education Minister Bill Byrne to take over the QYF\n\nMs Byrne has come under criticism over her lack of focus on schools\n\nMs Byrne has been criticised over the forum, which has been on a slow decline in recent years\n\nLabor called on the federal government to step in and hold Ms Byrne to account as the Queensland Youth Forum fell from prominence last year.\n\nUnder former education minister Kevin Andrews, Mr Byrne oversaw the QYF but has come under criticism for the state's sluggish education performance.\n\nQLD Premier Campbell Newman says he's been deeply offended by the forum and would welcome the State Government stepping in.\n\n\"The Federal Government, with its very significant investment in education, needs to step in and provide the $25 million it needs,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"We are well past the time where we need another state minister.\n\n\"It just makes a mockery of it in terms of the minister, with its own department, to take over.\"\n\n\"I think Bill Byrne, it would be a shame to see him not step in. That's not my job.\"\n\nThe Federal Government wants Education Minister Bill Byrne to take over the Queensland Youth Forum.\n\nTopics: education, education-industry, states-and-territories, qld\n\nFirst posted"
