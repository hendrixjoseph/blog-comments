Rhodes is referring to the attacks, and the deaths, of 45 people and wounding more than 50 others in June.\n\nRhodes claims that Islamic extremism is part of the reason why Muslim immigrants have so few rights in the U.S. and why the nation is becoming less \"American\". \"These people are Muslim-Americans: 'Muslim-American citizens are terrorists,'\" he said.\n\nThis claim is a lie. Muslim immigrants have always, and do in fact, pose an even greater threat to the US than the violent Muslims they are trying to protect.\n\nRhodes and his colleagues are pushing an anti-immigrant agenda with a clear motive, and in many ways a racist agenda.\n\nRhodes claims that Muslim immigrants have \"had some of the highest rates of anti-American sentiment of any immigrant group.\" What Rhodes doesn't tell you, or his audience, is that in the last year alone, the number of hate groups operating in the US â€” both large and small â€” has exploded â€” an increase of over 25 percent.\n\nIn February of this year, the Anti-Defamation League issued a report finding that \"Muslims are also the leading target of hate crimes in the U.S. The groups that operate the fastest include white supremacists; white nationalist groups, such as the Traditionalist Worker Party; neo-Confederate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations; and other groups with anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant or anti-Semitic ideologies.\"\n\nIn August of 2015, the Anti-Defamation League released a report listing over 20 racist groups operating in the US, and that the number is expected to ris \r\n<a href=https://wooriwin.com/>더킹카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.khangheshlaghi.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\nHeat wave to hit saurian island, officials say\n\nWATER DOWN IN HOSTAS, CA.â€”Housing was down a half-mile on Houseras County Road 576 Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nNortheast winds came through at about 6:30 a.m. and brought down power lines and toppled utility poles on both sides of the road. Several residents were rescued by fire crews, a spokesman said. The road remained closed for the morning.\n\nNortheast winds on Houseras County Road 576 in Yosemite National Park. (Photo: NPS)\n\nNortheast winds moved past Yosemite National Park at 5:45 a.m., according to the National Weather Service in Yosemite. The National Weather Service in Yosemite posted a wind direction of SE-NNE-SW on its live weather map that was live for 6:30 a.m.\n\nThere was widespread power outages throughout the area as of 9:50 a.m., and power at some sites was restored by 7 a.m., said Eric Beardsley, an NPS official in Yosemite.\n\nPower outages are common at times like this, Beardsley said.\n\nThe storm is expected to pick up as it moves across California, moving north-northwest before heading eastward along the Pacific Coast and into Mexico.\n\nIt will likely bring heavy rainfall to southern California, including in San Diego, as much as 10 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. The storm is expected to make a third landfall before moving away from the region, the weather service predicts.\n\nNo injuries were reported in Houseras County before 6 a.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis is the third high-pressure system to make for a high tide and storm surge in Santa Barbara County in about a week.\n\nOn Sept. 2, an extremely dangerous high in the Santa Barbara Mountains caused power outages, flooding and flooding of roads and bridges that shut down roads and bridges around the Santa Cruz area, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis time, an unusually intense high on Sept. 10 made for a storm surge of more than three feet, sending flood waters through Santa Barbara to the west.\n\nAn extreme high on Sept. 12 caused a powerful earthquake in the Sierra Nevada mountains where the Monterey Mountains converge near Mount Baker on the San Joaquin River.\n\nNortheast winds also created conditions for a strong, high-speed winds that left power outages in Long Beach, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nContributing: Kevin Barger, Steve Gorman, Brian Bouchard, Nesrine Malik, Eric B"
