Gov. Mary Fallin (R) wants the city council to make a stop at the state Capitol to ask for help for the project.\n\nIn 2015, the city council approved an easement in a zoning ordinance to construct the project in a building that would include all of the existing amenities and an adjoining parking garage that could accommodate an outdoor basketball court.\n\nThe project will be overseen by the city manager and Pruitt, who also serves on the Oklahoma State Board of Education. The project is estimated to cost between $50 million and $60 million.\n\n\"Our work should not be a sideshow,\" Fisher said of the project. \"Our goal, if we don't fix our infrastructure, is to have the capital to bring this here.\"\n\nThe arena sits on a 744-acre expanse of land and contains over 600 offices, homes and schools, many of which are open, including an elementary school and college campus. Construction crews had to cut grass and construct a deck to get the building into an acceptable state of good repair.\n\nThe project was approved in May and the state will need to approve or reject the agreement for the easement to go through. The city attorney's office is reviewing the project and hopes to have the project's site plan approved in December.\n\nThe project is likely to draw considerable opposition from the community, most notably the Oklahoman newspaper's editorial board, which said last month that the project could hurt Oklahoma's sports scene and would leave \"too many unemployed.\"\n\nThe state does not believe that the existing facilities are adequate for the needs of a professional sports team and has raised a number of concerns about the proposed facility.\n\nOfficials told KFOR that the land at the proposed site is not for housing construction and will likely be turned over to public recreation.
