She said when he tried to pull her by her arm she was screaming at him to stop and he pulled her arm again.\n\n\"He hit her on the arm and she went head on into the glass as the Toyota took it straight on top of her and he hit her face on the glass.\"\n\nGullick said the victim was left in a serious but stable condition in hospital last week.\n\nHis defence team told Sheffield Crown Court there had been a string of road collisions since the beginning of September.\n\nHis barrister, Barry Taylor QC, said: \"There are people out there who have run over people, hit people, thrown up women, women have been injured.\n\n\"We are appealing to the public to come forward and talk to police. We are a police force, we are responsible for everyone.\"\n\nDuring a recent court appearance, the victim had said she would now \"wish I didn't have to witness the trial.\"\n\nSentencing, CID Detective Inspector James Gullick added: \"If this has happened now, or ever again, you are making a terrible mistake. You have let into your victim. You have put your child's life at risk, you have injured and scarred this woman.\n\n\"I hope you will be careful of whom you bring into court. I am not asking you to be a vigilante, or to be a good boy.\""
