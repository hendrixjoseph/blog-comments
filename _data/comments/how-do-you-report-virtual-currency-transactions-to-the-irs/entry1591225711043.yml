message: "Amateur traders may turn served by 1-2% risk but then after having a couple \r\nlosses will usually raise the stakes to 4-5% risk.  This goes for both; it is possible \r\nto set an upper limit along with a lower limit therefore the system canautomatically sell in the event the numbers are comfortably high or low.\r\n\r\nThere are so many possible trades to create between all the various currencies and banks and individuals will always need to make currency exchanges."
