message: "Trying to find effective advertising that isn't completely full of it? I apologize for sending you this message on your contact form but actually that was the whole point. We can send your advertising message to websites via their contact forms just like you're getting this ad right now. You can specify targets by keyword or just start bulk blasts to websites in any country you choose. So let's say you want to send a message to all the interior decorators in the US, we'll scrape websites for just those and post your promo to them. As long as you're promoting some kind of offer that's relevant to that niche then you'll get awesome results! \r\n\r\nFire off a quick message to evie2535gre@gmail.com for details on how this works"
