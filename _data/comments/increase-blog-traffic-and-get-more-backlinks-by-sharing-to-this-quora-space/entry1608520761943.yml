message: "I leave a response whenever I especially enjoy a post on a website or if I have something to contribute to the discussion. Usually it's \r\ncaused by the fire displayed in the post I read. And \r\non this article blog topic. I was actually excited enough \r\nto drop a comment :-) I actually do have a couple of questions for you if it's allright.\r\nIs it simply me or do some of the responses come across like left by brain dead individuals?\r\n:-P And, if you are posting at other places, I \r\nwould like to follow you. Could you list all of your public sites \r\nlike your twitter feed, Facebook page or linkedin profile?"
